Project Outcome: Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program's discipline

Project Overview : Created Database design for Cougar Pizza store This project allowed me to gain experience as an IT consultant for creating design of a database for Cougar Pizza store. The reason company wanted a database, their plan was to expand their bussines locations in diffrent areas and they wanted their network to be interconnected. This project helped me to understand diffrent networking concepts and pros and cons such as client-server and peer to peer networking solutions.

Justification: This project started with my role being that of a consultant for IT solutions firm. This firm was tasked with designing a database for the Cougar Pizza stores in three new locations. The Store owners needed a database that will keep track of all the orders and allow for special instructions from customers as well. Since there is a limited number of items on the menu and limited toppings, along with the fixed pricing, the model for the menu will be simple. They would like to be able to determine if their new business is profitable easily by checking the data collected. They would also like to track all orders for market outreach and research purposes. The Morgans would also like to know if more than one pizza was ordered, and the time it takes to delivery each order. They would like the database to be able to handle additional stores in the future. All of this was done in short time for period because customer wanted database to be designed as soon as possible.

Reflection/ Articulation of Response: I had a great experience designing, writing code, and creating MS Visio diagrams for this project, the best part for me was when everything came together and was a completed polished artifact since one of the course outcomes is designing, implementing and evaluating solutions for a computer-based system. The knowledge gained from this project was learning how to write a data base in access, this was new to me, however, I am very proficient now and can-do basic operations and more with documentation present. I selected this artifact because of the amount I learned about design considerations for a database as well as this project gave me the ability to build a foundation for system design, implementation, and meeting customer requirements.
